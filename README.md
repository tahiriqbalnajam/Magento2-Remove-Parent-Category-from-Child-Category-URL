# Magento2 remove parent category from child category URL

##Installation:

Just upload the files and run command php magento/bin setup:upgrade

How it will work.

This plugin will not work directly, you have to save again each category. So in admin open category and save it again.
We are trying to acheive this in plugin that it run save command to update all categories soon.
